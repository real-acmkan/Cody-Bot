# Cody-Bot
Repository for Cody Kirk's IoT robot to solve his disability to not be physically present. Currently the committed code is a very minimal/basic insecure webserver, as the actual software/hardware I have designed has not recieved permission to be disclosed just yet.

## Status: WIP
This project is currently ongoing, more functionality is being added.
